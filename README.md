# NucleiClassification
The code of a  scale and region-enhanced decoding network for nuclei classification.[Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1746809423000599?via%3Dihub)


As part of this repository, we supply model weights trained on the following datasets: [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J_MLYH3cW2119ZVxGcXoCq_TOEsJuge0?usp=share_link)


Installation
======
This framework implementation is based on [HoverNet](https://github.com/vqdang/hover_net). Therefore the installation is the same as original HoverNet.

Acknowledgments
======
We would like to thank [HoverNet](https://github.com/vqdang/hover_net) for overall framework.
